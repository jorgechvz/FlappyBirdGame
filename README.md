# Flappy Bird Game with Pygame

# Overview

In this project, I've created a Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. The game challenges players to guide a bird through a series of pipes by clicking the mouse. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by navigating the bird through the pipes without colliding with them or the ground.

## How to Play

* Click the mouse to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
* Navigate the bird through the gaps between pipes.
* Avoid collisions with the pipes and the ground.
* The game ends if the bird collides with any obstacles.
* Strive to achieve the highest score by passing through as many pipes as possible.

## Purpose

As a software engineer, my primary aim in developing this game was to advance my skills in Python programming and game development, particularly with the Pygame library. This project allowed me to gain practical experience in implementing game mechanics, managing user input, and handling game state.
